Things I should add to this module before releasing it...

1. Possibly calculate the beginning and ending lines within the text... make it an option for users who want it.
1a. Make it an option to the main parse method and/or add a method that does it by default?
2. Make an option/additional method to *extract* the pod from the passed in text.

Other possible things to do...
 * Split the regexes up in such a way that a user can feed in an array of lines, and/or do "lazy parsing"
   (However, I think that's going to be too much effort for too little reward given 90% of use-cases.)

  * Add option to pass a filename instead of a raw string and have it open and parse that file.
