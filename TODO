Things I should add to this module before releasing it...

1. Make sure the 'pos' field in the output hashes are truly the last character of that paragraph.
2. Add a 'start_pos' field to the hash to indicate the starting character of the paragraph
3. If 'start_pos' works, change 'pos' to 'end_pos'
4. Possibly calculate the beginning and ending lines within the text... make it an option for users who want it.
4a. Make it an option to the main parse method and add a method that does it by default?
5. Make an option/additional method to *extract* the pod from the passed in text.
5a. question - should I require the text be a ref that gets modified or should I return it in the data???

Other possible things to do...
Split the regexes up in such a way that a user can feed in an array of lines, and/or do "lazy parsing"

However, I think that's going to be too much effort for too little reward given 90% of use-cases.

Another possibility, add helper option to pass a filename instead of a raw string and have it open and parse that file.
