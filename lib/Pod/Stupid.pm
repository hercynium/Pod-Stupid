=method strip_string

given a string or string ref, and (optionally) an array of pod pieces,
return a copy of the string with all pod stripped out and an AoH
containing the pod pieces. If passed a string ref, that string is
modified in-place. In any case you can still always get the stripped
string and the array of pod parts as return values.

  # most typical usage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module was written to do one B<simple> thing: Given some text
as input, split it up into pieces of POD "paragraphs" and non-POD
"whatever" and output an AoH describing each piece found, in order.

The end user can do whatever s?he wishes with the output AoH. It is
trivially simple to reconstruct the input from the output, and
hopefully I've included enough information in the inner hashes that
one can easily perform just about any other manipulation desired.

=head1 INDESCRIPTION

There are a bunch of things this module will B<NOT> do:

=for :list
* Create a "parse tree"
* Pod validation (it either parses or not)
* Pod cleanup
* "Handle" encoded text (but it I<should> still parse)
* Feed your cat

However, it may make it easier to do any of the above, with a lot
less time and effort spent trying to grok many of the other POD
parsing solutions out there.

A particular design decision I've made is to avoid needing to save
any state. This means there's no need or advantage to instantiating
an object, except for your own preferences. You can use any method
as either an object method or a class method and it will work the
same way for both. This design should also discourage me from trying
to bloat Pod::Stupid with every feature that tickles my fancy (or
yours!) but still, B<I encourage any feature requests!>

=head1 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

=for :list
* Currently only works on files with unix-style line endings.

=head1 TODO

This is only what I've thought of... B<suggestions *very* welcome!!!>

=for :list
* Fix aforementioned limitation
* More comprehensive tests
* A utility module to do common things with the output

=head1 POD TERMINOLOGY FOR DUMMIES (aka: me)

=head2 paragraphs

In Pod, everything is a paragraph. A paragraph is simply one or more
consecutive lines of text. Multiple paragraphs are separated from each other
by one or more blank lines.

Some paragraphs have special meanings, as explained below.

=head2 command

A command (aka directive) is a paragraph whose first line begins with a
character sequence matching the regex m/^=([a-zA-Z]\S*)/

I've actually been a bit more generous, matching m/^=(\w+)/ instead.
Don't rely on that though. I may have to change to be closer to the spec
someday.

In the above regex, the type of command would be in $1. Different types of
commands have different semantics and validation rules yadda yadda.

Currently, the following command types (directives) are described in the
Pod Spec L<http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpodspec.html> and technically,
a proper Pod parser should consider anything else an error. (I won't though)

=for :list
* head[\d] (\d is a number from 1-4)
* pod
* cut
* over
* item
* back
* begin
* end
* for
* encoding

=head2 directive

Ostensibly a synonym for a command paragraph, I consider it a subset of that,
specifically the "command type" as described above.

=head2 verbatim paragraph

This is a paragraph where each line begins with whitespace.

=head2 ordinary paragraph

This is a prargraph where each line does B<not> begin with whitespace

=head2 data paragraph

This is a paragraph that is between a pair of "=begin identifier" ...
"=end identifier" directives where "identifier" does not begin with a
literal colon (":")

I do not plan on handling this type of paragraph in any special way.

=head2 block

A Pod block is a series of paragraphs beginning with any directive except
"=cut" and ending with the first occurence of a "=cut" directive or the
end of the input, whichever comes first.

=head2 piece

This is a term I'm introducting myself. A piece is just a hash containing info
on a parsed piece of the original string. Each piece is either pod or not pod.
If it's pod it describes the kind of pod. If it's not, it contains a 'non_pod'
entry. All pieces also include the start and end offsets into the original
string (starting at 0) as 'start_pos' and 'end_pos', respectively.
